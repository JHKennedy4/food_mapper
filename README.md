#FoodMapper
FoodMapper exists to help researchers document the availability and pricing of food in the United States. Specifically in those markets authorized to accept SNAP.

FoodMapper is built on rails and backed by a PostGIS datastore.

Market locations are sourced from the [SNAP Retailer Locator] provided by the USDA.

The market report form is based on the USDA Thrifty Food Plan Food Store Survey Instrument by Barbara Cohen. It is  available in Appendix C of [Desert in the Springs: Ethnography of a Food Desert](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6003&context=etd) by Margeax Alana Chavez of the University of South Florida.

PRs welcome.
